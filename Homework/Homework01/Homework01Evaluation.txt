======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

BEAUTIFUL work on this one.  Try to make sure your indenting
is consistent - you have different spacing in the two files.
Otherwise you code is very nice.  You could use a few more
test cases; there were five required for "getMax()" and you
only have one.

Still, works as advertised!  Keep up the good work!

you got 9.2 out of 10 which is 92% which is an A-minus
