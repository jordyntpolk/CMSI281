======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Your MyFileCopier.java seems to be a copy of your TargetFile.java.
I can give you SOME credit for the work but not all....

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you actually have a
MyFileCopier.java file somewhere, but I can only give you 1/2 credit
on that.

Sorry.
