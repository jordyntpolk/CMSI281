Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

A couple of comments:

Alas, Jordyn, your code doesn't compile.  There are a total
of 4 errors.  The first three come from IntQueue.java and the
last one is from IntLinkedList.java.

Since your code won't compile, I can't evaluate its operation
but you'll still get credit for the rest of the items.

scores:
