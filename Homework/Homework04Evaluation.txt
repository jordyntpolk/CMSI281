Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Pretty good job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Gabe's repo.

Everything compiles on its own, but if I try to compile them all at
one time with "javac *.java" I get a bunch of errors because there
are two "Node" classes that conflict with each other.

InOrderTreeApp works, but I'm not sure it's quite correct.  Close
enough for rock and roll, though it's hard to tell because the tree
representation is a bit off...

Nice work on the Priority Queue.  Testing is very good and I can
easily tell what is being tested by the output!  Nice...

String Hasher has a menu problem -- only delete works when I enter
the letter 'd', and all the others tell me 'Invalid entry!'.  I had
to look at the code to find that you are using "a, b, c, d" instead
of what should be "s, i, d, f".  It does work after that, however,
the premise was to hash strings and insert the STRING values into the
table, NOT REAL NUMBERS.  I'll have to give you only 1/2 credit on
the hashing function for that reason.  That may be the problem which
causes the delete method to NOT take out duplicate values from the
table.

FoldingHashTable doesn't seem to work.  I start it with a table size
of 193 like with everyone else's, but any number I enter for the set
of starting values causes an exception.  The code is there, but it
doesn't work, so I'll give you 1/2 credit on that one.
